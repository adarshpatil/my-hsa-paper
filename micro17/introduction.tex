\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}



\par The remarkable advances in computing power of the modern microprocessor over the last few decades can predominantly be attributed to shrinking of feature sizes. Miniaturization of transistors has allowed addition of specialized on-chip hardware circuitry for acceleration units. 
A study in 2010 by Koomey et. al \cite{koomey} found that the amount of computation that could be done per unit of energy doubled about every 18 months. However, to reach exascale and beyond requires a thousand fold decrease in energy consumed per flop computed. Graphics processing units (GPUs) have evolved from being fixed-function pipelines and are being used to accelerate data parallel code for general purpose (GP) applications. Compared with multi-core CPUs, GPGPUs offer the potential for better performance at lower energy. Traditionally these discrete processors have had their own independent memory systems. To take advantage of the discrete GPUs, the CPU must copy data to the GPUs memory and back. This data movement is wasteful and expends energy while also adding latency as the transfer happens over a slower PCIe bus. The separate address spaces and complex programming models that need to manage 2 sets of data further impede expansion of the workloads that benefit from GPGPU computing.

\par Modern processor chips have heterogeneous processors which integrate a lower capacity GPUs on-die allowing for graphics rendering only. In view of the widespread use of the GPU for general purpose applications, processor manufacturers including AMD\cite{amd-apu}, Intel\cite{inteliris}, and NVIDIA\cite{denver} are beginning to allow general purpose OpenCL\cite{opencl}/CUDA\cite{cuda} programs to run on their Integrated Heterogeneous System (IHS) platform which were so far restricted to graphics rendering. The HSA Foundation \cite{hsafoundation} was setup to develop and define cross-vendor hardware specifications and software development tools needed to allow application software to better use this IHS architecture. This IHS architecture, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:hsa-arch}, provides a shared virtual address space making pointer sharing semantics possible between CPU and GPU which simplifies programming. Further, a shared physical address space and the cache coherent interconnect reduces GPU initialization time and enables several high level languages \cite{sumatra,julia} to also take advantage of the parallel processing synergistically with the CPU. Programmers can now write applications that seamlessly integrate CPUs with GPUs while benefiting from best attributes of each. Fine-grain parallel stream processing like face detection, compression, encryption-decryption etc. can now use the integrated GPGPU to deliver better performance. Recent works have proposed allowing GPUs to invoke traditional operating systems paging mechanisms and hardware MMUs to fault pages \cite{tlb-translation}. This provides the added benefit to be able to run GPU programs whose dataset sizes are not constrained by the memory size. As IHS platforms gain widespread adoption in HPC systems, improving the performance of these platforms will become of paramount importance in the near future. \cite{apu-exascale,amd-exascale1}

\par In contrast to the processing capabilities of the modern microprocessor, DRAM memory speeds have not kept pace commensurately to serve the increasing demands of the processors. This speed imbalance coupled with a limited growth in pin counts has led to the memory and bandwidth wall \cite{memory-wall,bandwidth-wall} for off-chip DRAM systems which often becomes a performance limiting factor. The advent of die-stacking technology \cite{3d-stacking} provides a way to integrate disparate silicon die of NMOS DRAM chips and CMOS logic chips with better interconnects. The implementation is accomplished either by 3D vertical stacking of DRAM chips using through-silicon vias (TSV) interconnects or horizontally/2.5D stacking on a interposer chip as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:hsa-arch}. This allows the addition of a sizable DRAM chip of capacities ranging from a couple of hundreds of megabytes to a few gigabytes close to the processing cores. These stacked DRAM devices provide high bandwidths of close to 400GB/s compared to the 90GB/s of DDR4 bandwidth \cite{xeonphi}. The better interconnect also lowers the latency of access by around 20-25\% compared to off-chip memory [ref]. Several recent proposals advocate the use of on-chip DRAM capacity as a hardware managed large last level cache for improving performance of multicore CMPs \cite{alloy,bimodal,loh-hill,atcache}. In the context of IHS architecture, the stacked DRAM can cater to the large bandwidth requirements of throughput oriented GPUs while the latency-sensitive CPU applications can benefit from reduced latency of data access. This also reduces energy consumed per access for the overall system in line with the goals of IHS.
\par Managing contention for shared DRAMCache in the memory hierarchy of the two heterogeneous processor architectures which have asymmetric sensitivity and demands introduces novel challenges. When a GPU kernel is launched it creates large number of concurrent threads which run in lock-step SIMD execution model and sends a large number of requests into the memory hierarchy causing congestion. This causes bottlenecks in request queues and contention for sets in the DRAMCache thus severely hampering CPU performance. 

Although the GPUs are designed to tolerate longer memory latencies, the memory hierarchy of typical CPUs have been designed to optimize memory access latencies for CPUs and CPU applications.
Hard partitioning of resources (DRAM Cache, memory and NOC bandwidth) would not be effective and leads to under-utilization as GPU applications (kernels) run intermittently. 
This necessitates the need for a careful design of memory system for IHS processors, that can handle the GPGPU bursty behavior as well as service requests for the CPU with a seamless/consistent latency without idling resources while delivering improved system throughput at lower energy.

To improve the performance of IHS systems and address these problem, we propose to introduce a large capacity stacked DRAMCache, used as a hardware managed cache, as the first level shared resource in the memory hierarchies of CPU and GPU cores. Our organization, \cachename, is aware of the asymmetric and contrasting requirements from the heterogeneous processors. \cachename attempts to meet CPUs requirement of reduced hit times and lower miss penalties while at the same time improving hit rates for GPU to allow it to better use the DRAMCache bandwidth. In the common case when CPU is running alone, \textit{\cachename} is a aggressive direct mapped DRAMCache optimized for hit times and lower miss penalty through hit/miss prediction as in \cite{alloy}. However, when GPU is active, the CPU requests are prioritized at the DRAMCache to reduce the effect of large waiting time caused due to burst of GPU requests. Second, when GPU is running, some of the CPU requests (access requests that are clean data in DRAMCache or data that is currently not in DRAMCache) are temporally bypassed to utilize the under-utilized DRAM memory bandwidth. 
%We propose a simple bloom filter based implementation to identify requests that can be bypassed. 
Third, \cachename forces spatial occupancy control by providing a pseudo associativity for GPUs to improve hit rates while still allowing certain guranteed occupancy for CPU lines. \cachename achieves these goals using a lightweight and dynamic scheme which does not impose hard partitions on the shared resources cache.

%% What about OSCAR? We shd. say a few sentences on OSCAR, but say they focus on sharing of network resoures. Similar
%% thing holds for other work of Penn State Group on HSA and also the Georgia Tech. work (Yalamanchali).. We shd. 
% also briefly talk about the Helm work (Mekkat et al..) any other work? then conclude with the first sentence. 
% % adarsh: should we just move this to related works?
%\par To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the interactions of IHS with a shared stacked DRAMCache. 

\par While there have been studies and proposals to share the on-chip last-level SRAM caches \cite{helm} and non-volatile NVM based caches \cite{oscar} in IHS architectures previously, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study on the interactions of such an architecture with a shared stacked DRAMCache. Our proposal \cachename addresses problems unique to stacked DRAMs and applies optimizations accordingly to address these challenges. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{motivation} demonstrates the performance that can be gained by adding a DRAMCache to a IHS processor chip and motivates the need for architecting an heterogeneity aware DRAMCache organization. We present the organization and design principles of \cachename in \ref{design} and  describe its working in Section \ref{mechanism} . Next, in Section \ref{methodology} we describe the experimental setup and methodology followed by evaluation results in Section \ref{results}. Section \ref{related-work} presents related work in this area and Section \ref{conclusion} concludes the paper.
