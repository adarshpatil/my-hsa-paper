\section{Introduction}

This document is intended to serve as a sample for submissions to ISCA 2016. It is heavily derived from previous conferences, in particular MICRO 2015 and HPCA 2016.

We provide some guidelines that authors should follow when submitting papers to the conference. \textbf{This format is derived from the ACM \texttt{sig-alternate.cls} file, with the major difference that it is 10pt Times font}.

In an effort to respect the efforts of reviewers and in the interest of fairness to all prospective authors, we request that all submissions follow the formatting and submission rules detailed below. Submissions that (grossly) violate these instructions may not be reviewed, at the discretion of the Program Chair, in order to maintain a review process that is fair to all potential authors.

\vspace{1ex}In a nutshell:

\begin{itemize}
\item Paper must be submitted in printable PDF format.
\item Text must be minimum 10pt Times font.
\item Papers must be at most 11 pages, not including references, in two-column format.
\item References must include all authors to facilitate the reviewing process (no \emph{et al.})
\item There is no page limit for references.
\end{itemize}
