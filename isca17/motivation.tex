\section{Motivation} \label{motivation}
As seen in section \ref{introduction}i, incorporating GPU into the same die as CMPs provides for several advantages and the use of this as a general purpose computing resource is gaining traction in applications. However the directions for improving the performance of these integrated contrasting processors is not straight forward. In this work we propose the addition of a large capacity stacked DRAM between CPU and GPU. This capacity will be used as a last level cache before accessing the off-chip DRAM. Adding smaller capacity SRAM caches as shared levels does not contribute much to performance (why?) and DRAMs are better suited to handle larger number of requests and interference (why?). And hence the DRAMCache is the first level shared memory capacity in the hierarchy of the 2 processors.
