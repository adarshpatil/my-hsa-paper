\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\par The remarkable advances in computing power of the modern microprocessor over the last few decades can predominantly be attributed to Moore's Law and advances in manufacturing technology that has allowed shrinking of transistor sizes. Miniaturization of transistors has allowed addition of specialized on-chip hardware circuitry for acceleration units. A study in 2010 by Koomey et. al \cite{koomey} found that the amount of computation that could be done per unit of energy doubled about every 18 months. However, to reach exascale and beyond requires a thousand fold decrease in energy consumed per flop computed. Graphics processing units (GPUs) have evolved from being fixed-function pipelines and are being used to accelerate data parallel code for general purpose (GP) applications. Compared with multi-core CPUs, GPGPUs offer the potential for better performance at lower energy. Traditionally these discrete processors have had their own independent memory systems. To take advantage of the discrete GPUs, the CPU must copy data to the GPUs memory and back. This data movement is wasteful and expends energy while also adding latency as the transfer happens over a slower PCIe bus. The separate address spaces and complex programming models that need to manage 2 sets of data further impede expansion of the workloads that benefit from GPGPU computing. 
\par Modern processor chips have had lower capacity GPUs on-die allowing for graphics rendering only. However in view of the widespread use of the GPU for general purpose applications, processor manufacturers including AMD\cite{amd-apu}, Intel\cite{inteliris}, and NVIDIA\cite{denver} are beginning to allow general purpose OpenCL/CUDA programs to run on their Integrated Heterogeneous System (IHS) platform which were so far restricted to graphics rendering. To this effect the HSA Foundation \cite{hsafoundation} was setup to develop and define cross-vendor hardware specifications and software development tools needed to allow application software to better use this architecture. This architecture provides a shared virtual address space making pointer sharing semantics possible on CPU and GPU which simplifies programming. Further a shared physical address space reduces GPU initialization time and enables several high level languages to also take advantage of the parallel processing synergistically with the CPU. Programmers can now write applications that seamlessly integrate CPUs with GPUs while benefiting from best attributes of each. Finer-grain data parallel sections in applications like garbage collection \cite{sumatra} of virtual machines and parallel stream processing like face detection, compression, encryption-decryption etc. can now use the integrated GPGPU to deliver better performance. This integrated architecture also has the added advantage of being able to run programs whose dataset sizes are not constrained by the size of memory on the GPU. The GPU can invoke traditional operating systems paging mechanisms and hardware MMUs to fault pages. As IHS platforms gain widespread adoption in HPC systems, improving the performance of these platforms will become of paramount importance in the near future. AMD proposed designs also hints towards this direction \cite{apu-exascale}
\par In contrast to the processing capabilities of the modern microprocessor, DRAM memory speeds have not kept pace commensurately to serve the increasing demands of the processors. This speed imbalance coupled with a limited growth in pin counts has led to the memory \cite{memory-wall} and bandwidth \cite{bandwidth-wall} wall for off-chip DRAM systems which often becomes a performance limiting factor. The advent of die-stacking technology \cite{3d-stacking} provides a way to integrate disparate silicon die of NMOS DRAM chips and CMOS logic chips with better interconnects. The implementation is accomplished either by 3D vertical stacking of DRAM chips using through-silicon vias (TSV) interconnects or horizontally/2.5D stacking on a interposer chip as depicted in Figure \ref{hsa-arch}. This allows the addition of a sizable DRAM chip close to processing cores. The onchip DRAM memory can provide anywhere from a couple of hundreds of megabytes to a few gigabytes of storage at high bandwidths of 400GB/s compared to the 90GB/s of DDR4 bandwidth [ref]. The better interconnect also lowers the latency of access by around 20-25\% compared to off-chip memory [ref]. This on-chip DRAM capacity has been advocated to be used as a large last level cache which is transparent to software for improveming performance of multicore CMPs in several works in literature. In the context of IHS chips, the high bandwidth stacked DRAMCache can cater to large bandwidth requirements of the throughput oriented GPUs which exploit high levels of MLP while latency oriented CPU applications can also benefit from reduced latency of data access from the stacked DRAMCache thus providing improved overall system performance. The stacked DRAM Cache also reduces energy consumed per access for the overall system in line with the goals of IHS.
\par As we race towards exascale compute facilities more of the die will be use for processing elements and accommodating larger size SRAM based caches or even higher density STT-RAM based caches \cite{oscar} of sizes which will be useful for these large number of computing elements will become increasingly difficult. These on die caches also suffer from congestion on the NoC and require special designs to be efficient. An alternate to this is to use vertical die stacking to provide large capacity caches which have significant bandwidth and some latency benefits as well.
\par This introduces novel challenges in managing contention for shared DRAMCache in the memory hierarchy of the two heterogeneous processor architectures. When a GPU kernel is launched it creates large number of concurrently running threads in lock-step in a SIMD execution model and sends large number of requests into the memory hierarchy, which creates a temporary flood of requests while the GPU is executing. The GPU can also switch execution between groups of threads to hide this memory access latency and exploit available parallelism which further exacerbates the problem. This causes bottlenecks in request queues and contention for sets in the DRAMCache thus severally hampering CPU performance. Although the GPU can sustain longer memory latencies, as capabilities of execution units in GPUs of IHS chips increase, threads will be able issue larger number of memory requests more rapidly and available parallelism to hide memory latency decreases, thus reducing throughput of the entire system. Since the GPGPU will be used intermittently for offloading parallel parts of the program, simply reserving shared resources will lead to idling and under-utilization of resources. Also, biasing the design for throughput or latency will adversely impact the performance of the other processor. This necessitates the need for careful design of a memory system for IHS processors, that can handle the GPGPU bursty behavior as well as service requests for the CPU with a consistent latency without idling resources and delivering improved system throughput at lower energy.

The primary contributions of this work are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item We propose the addition of a large capacity stacked DRAM for IHS processors. This first level shared memory capacity between CPU and GPU would be used a last-level cache to contain the majority of the large working set of GPU which otherwise will not fit in a on-chip SRAM cache. The considerable bandwidth provided by the DRAMCache should benefit GPU programs and the lower latency of access will assist latency sensitive CPU applications. 
\item We study the effects of sharing this resource between the processors and show that conventional DRAMCache architectures do not perform well when applied naively for IHS processors. This is the first of the kind evaluation for a IHS setup.
\item We propose an intelligent IHS aware scheme for managing occupancy levels for a direct mapped DRAMCache called \textit{PISTON}. \textit{PISTON} is lightweight and at the same time avoids explicit cache partitioning which would result in unused capacity when either cores are idle. \textit{PISTON} does not compromise on .
\item The predictor is central to extracting performance from a DRAMCache by avoiding high latency tags-in-DRAM lookups by predicting a miss ahead of time and starting an early fill request to memory in parallel. We adapt the DRAMCache predictor to be IHS aware in concordance with our occupancy control mechanism. This allows each type of processor to maximize the use of bandwidth and latency benefits provided by the DRAMCache.
\item Finally we enable \textit{PISTON} to dynamically adjust occupancy at runtime for varying cache requirements of heterogeneous cores to maximize the overall system throughput that can be got by using this DRAMCache.

\end{itemize}
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the interactions of IHS with a shared stacked DRAMCache. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{motivation} demonstrates the performance that can be gained by adding a DRAMCache to a IHS chip and motivates the need for architecting an IHS aware approach to DRAMCache organization. We present the principles of PISTON Cache and its descibe its working in Section \ref{mechanism} . Next, in Section \ref{methodology} we show the experimental setup and methodology followed by evaluation results in Section \ref{results}. Section \ref{related-work} presents related work in this area and Section \ref{conclusion} concludes the paper.
