\section{Results} \label{results}
In this section, we examine the results of applying our mechanisms to the DRAMCache over an IHS setup.
\subsection{PrIS DRAMCache scheduling}
Prioritizing CPU requests at the DRAMCache controller leads to good performance benefits. However, 
\subsection{ByE for Temporal bypass}

\subsection{Chaining for Spatial Occupancy Control}
We empirically determine the low occupancy threshold of the CPU \textit{$l_{cpu}$} in the cache to be 25\% for all our workloads.
