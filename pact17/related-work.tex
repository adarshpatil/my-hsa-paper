Stacked DRAM devices have primarily been organized to improve the performance of multi-core architectures. Principally there have been 2 schools of thought for using the stacked DRAM devices. In \cite{pom,cameo} the stacked DRAMs are organized as part of memory to in lieu of the large capacities provided by these devices. The designs propose the hardware management schemes for swapping hot pages into and out of the stacked DRAM devices. These designs can potentially suffer from large swapping overheads due to the large and disparate working sets of IHS workloads increasing the number of hot pages in the system.
%On the other hand, designs proposing to expose the stacked DRAM to the applications by providing allocation calls to the allow applications to place data in the high bandwidth memory are also in use. These designs suffer from the obvious overheads of application modification to improve performance.
\par On the other hand, several designs propose to use the stacked DRAM as transparent hardware managed cache. In section \ref{design} we have already alluded some of the works of DRAMCache design and organization \cite{alloy,atcache.bimodal.loh-hill}. \cachename extends and adapts the simplicity and effectiveness of the Alloy Cache for IHS workloads after carefully considering the heterogeneity of the requests.
